## About AlumniDoor

### Learning Challenges as a Frontend Developer

As a frontend developer working on AlumniDoor, you may encounter the following learning challenges:

- **State Management**: "State management is a complex task, but the Context API has made it significantly easier to handle. As a frontend developer, my goal is to leverage the React.js framework to its fullest potential. One of the challenges I face is effectively managing components and ensuring they are properly controlled by their parent components."

- **Responsive Design**: Designing and implementing responsive user interfaces with Material-UI and Tailwind CSS to ensure a seamless experience across different devices.

- **Routing**: Routing presented one of the most significant challenges and learning opportunities as a software developer. Deciding how to effectively route pages was a complex task, and I encountered several major errors along the way. However, by thoroughly reviewing the documentation and exploring community articles, I was able to resolve these issues and gain a deeper understanding of the process.

- **Component Lifecycle**: Gaining a deep understanding of React component lifecycle methods and hooks to manage component behavior and state.

- **Post Management**: Implementing features to create, edit, delete, and display posts efficiently. Ensuring that posts are displayed in real-time and managing the state of posts across different components.

- **Message Management**: Developing a robust messaging system that allows users to send and receive messages in real-time.

These challenges provide additional opportunities to enhance your skills in managing dynamic content and real-time communication in web applications.

### Tech Stack (Frontend)

- **React JS**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Context API**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework for designing responsive web apps.
- **React Router**: A library for routing in React applications.
